🛡️ Phishing Website Detection

📌 Introduction
Phishing is a major cyber threat where attackers trick users into revealing sensitive information by disguising malicious websites as legitimate ones. Detecting such websites in real-time is crucial to protect users from fraud, identity theft, and data breaches.
This project applies Machine Learning algorithms to detect phishing websites based on features extracted from their URLs, domain information, and webpage attributes. The system classifies websites as either legitimate or phishing with high accuracy.

📂 Dataset
The dataset contains features extracted from website URLs and HTML attributes.
Features include:
URL length
Presence of “@” symbol
Use of HTTPS protocol
Number of redirects
Domain age, DNS records, etc.
Target variable:
1 → Phishing
-1 → Legitimate
